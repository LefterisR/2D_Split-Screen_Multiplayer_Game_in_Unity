### Game Functionality

For this project, we decided to implement the player character control system using a keyboard and mouse for Player 1 and a game console controller for Player 2. Menu navigation is done exclusively with a mouse.
In the final stages of game development we added the ability to choose between two control scemes. Playing with MK and Controller or a Split Keyboad method. 

Control Scheme 1 - Keyboard & Mouse / Controller:

Player 1:
  -  Move Left/Right: A and D
  -  Jump: Spacebar
  -  Action 1: Mouse Button 1
  -  Action 2: Mouse Button 2 
    
Player 2:
   - Move Left/Right: Left joystick
   - Jump: X or A
   - Action 1: Square (☐) or X
   - Action 2: Circle (O) or B

Control Scheme 2 – Two Players / Split Keyboard:

Player 1:
  -  Move Left/Right: A and D
  -  Jump: W
  -  Action 1: T
  -  Action 2: Y

Player 2:
   - Move Left/Right: Left and Right Arrow Keys
   - Jump: Up Arrow Key
   - Action 1: * (Numpad)
   - Action 2: - (Numpad)

## Build Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Build Instructions

Unity provides an easy process for compiling and building the project.

In menu: File>Build we can select the OS and processor architecture for the build and which scenes will be shipped in the final product, while by just pressing the build button the task runs automatically. We can run the playable game from the generated .exe file (for windows)
