Game Functionality

For this project, we decided to implement the player character control system using a keyboard and mouse for Player 1 and a game console controller for Player 2. Menu navigation is done exclusively with a mouse.
In the final stages of game development we added the ability to choose between two control scemes. Playing with MK and Controller or a Split Keyboad method. 

Control Scheme 1 - Keyboard & Mouse / Controller:

Player 1:
    Move Left/Right: A and D
    Jump: Spacebar
    Action 1: Mouse Button 1
    Action 2: Mouse Button 2 
    
Player 2:
    Move Left/Right: Left joystick
    Jump: X or A
    Action 1: Square (‚òê) or X
    Action 2: Circle (O) or B

Control Scheme 2 ‚Äì Two Players / Split Keyboard:

Player 1:
    Move Left/Right: A and D
    Jump: W
    Action 1: T
    Action 2: Y

Player 2:
    Move Left/Right: Left and Right Arrow Keys
    Jump: Up Arrow Key
    Action 1: * (Numpad)
